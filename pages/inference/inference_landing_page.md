## What is Statistical Inference?

*From Wikipedia-*

Statistical inference is the process of using data analysis to deduce properties of an underlying distribution of probability.[1] Inferential statistical analysis infers properties of a population, for example by testing hypotheses and deriving estimates. It is assumed that the observed data set is sampled from a larger population.
