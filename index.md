## About

The NRT Library for Data Science and Human Behavior (DS&HB Library for short) is a community maintained hub for educational resources at the intersection of Data Science and Human Behavior.

## How to navigate this website

There are two navigation bars on the left-pane of the website. The one **at the top** allows you to navigate the subtopics within a larger topic or section. The one **at the bottom** (**Table of Contents**) allows to navigate the contents within a page (i.e., within a subtopic). For instance: [Natural Language Processing](nlp_landing_page) is a topic/section with several subtopics like [Sentiment Analysis](sentiment_analysis) and [Semantic Vectors](semantic_vectors). The tree structure looks like:

[Natural Language Processing](nlp_landing_page):  
    - [Sentiment Analysis](sentiment_analysis)  
    - [Semantic Vectors](semantic_vectors)

Once you select a subtopic, you wil see that the **Table of Contents** sidebar will display the contents within that subtopics.

## Library topics
