## About

The NRT Library for Data Science and Human Behavior is a community-maintained hub for students and scientists who study human behavior to understand and apply new data-science methods, concepts, and techniques coming out of machine-learning, AI, and other fields. While there exist many online tutorials, videos, blogs, and other resources for learning about data-science, many of these are geared toward workers in industry, programmers, other communities with extensive technical expertise, or other domains of science. This library curates resources of specific interest and utility for those of us who study cognition, perception, action, language, neuroscience, social interactions, and other aspects of human behavior.

## How to navigate this website

There are two navigation bars on the left-pane of the website. The one **at the top** allows you to navigate the subtopics within a larger topic or section. The one **at the bottom** (**Table of Contents**) allows to navigate the contents within a page (i.e., within a subtopic). For instance: [Natural Language Processing](nlp_landing_page) is a topic/section with several subtopics like [Sentiment Analysis](sentiment_analysis) and [Semantic Vectors](semantic_vectors). The tree structure looks like:

[Natural Language Processing](nlp_landing_page):  
    - [Sentiment Analysis](sentiment_analysis)  
    - [Semantic Vectors](semantic_vectors)

Once you select a subtopic, you wil see that the **Table of Contents** sidebar will display the contents within that subtopics.

## Library topics

The full list of topics can be foun in the [Table of Topics](mydoc_topics.html) section in the sidebar and in the `Topics` drop-down menu tab in the top navigation bar.
